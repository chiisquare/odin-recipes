   <h1>Jjajangmyeon Recipe from Maangchi</h1>

   <h2> Description</h2>
   <p>This is a popular Korean noodle dish, but the fried black bean sauce, vegetable, and pork mixture can be eaten with rice instead (which is then called "jjajangbap"). It originates from a northern Chinese noodle dish named zhájiàngmiàn, which uses ground pork instead. Despite the dark coloring of the sauce, the flavor is milder than its appearance may suggest, but it is no less tasty for it. For a richer, more luxe version of this dish, consider adding seafood to this dish. Of course, you are welcome to swap the pork for a different protein source entirely, based on your preference. </p>
   <p>I would allot around 2 hours to prepare the sauce and carb source for this dish, especially if you are a novice cook like myself. The noodles are best consumed within a few hours as their chewiness is not retained as well after being refrigerated and reheated. Have some kimchi and/or yellow pickled radish in the fridge to later serve with the dish for a truly deluxe meal along with a bib or napkin on hand to wipe this yummy black sauce from your mouth! I'm salivating as I write this!</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients (serves 2-3)</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>~¾ lb of jjajangmyeon noodles (or roughly 2 cups of rice if you wish to make jjajangbap instead; adjust based on your hunger level)</li>
        <li>½ pound pork belly, cut into ½ inch cubes (about 1½ cups’ worth)</li>
        <li>1 cup of Korean radish (or daikon), cut into ½ inch cubes (about 1 cup’s worth)</li>
        <li>1 cup of zucchini, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup of potato, peeled and cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
        <li>1½ cups of onion chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon of black bean paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of potato starch powder, combined with ¼ cup water and 1 teaspoon of sugar in a small bowl, set aside</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ cup cucumber, cut into thin matchsticks for garnish</li>
        <li>water</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok with 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Pour out the excess pork fat.</li>
        <li>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
        <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of water to the wok and let it cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they are fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it is well mixed and thick.</li>
        <li>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap).</li>
   </ol>
