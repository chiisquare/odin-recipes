   <h2> Description</h2>
   <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients (serves 4)</h2>
   <h3>For the marinade/sauce:</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>5 candlenuts or cashews, or 10 blanched almonds</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 fresh chiles, cut into medium chunks</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground coriander</li>
        <li>Finely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75 g) raw peanuts, finely ground</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kecap manis (or 1 teaspoon sugar), plus more for the sauce</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>For the satay:</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>1 pound 10 ounces (750 g) boneless, skinless dark chicken meat, cut into long strips 1/4-inch (0.5 cm) thick</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Soak 14 medium bamboo skewers for 30 minutes in cold water.</li>
        <li>To make the marinade: Put the candlenuts, garlic, chilies, and a little salt in a mortar and grind with a pestle until you have a fine pasteâ€”you can also do this in a food processor. Transfer to a bowl. Add the coriander, black pepper, and cayenne and mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the candlenut-garlic mixture and fry until lightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the peanuts and kecap manis and fry for another couple of minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare a charcoal fire in an outdoor grill or preheat the broiler to high.</li>
        <li>To prepare the satay: Marinate the chicken in the sauce for at least 30 minutes or longer, then scrape the marinade off the chicken before threading it equally onto the skewers. Grill or broil for 3 minutes on each side, or until completely cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, scrape the leftover marinade into a small saucepan. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) water and a little more kecap manis (or a little sugar) and bring to a boil over medium heat. Transfer to a small bowl and serve as a dipping sauce with the grilled chicken.</li>  
   </ol>
