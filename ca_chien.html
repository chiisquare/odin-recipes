    <h2> Description</h2>
     <p><em>Cá chiên nước mắm</em> is Vietnamese for fried fish with fish sauce. It is a Vietnamese dish consisting of, well, deep-fried fish that is served with a dipping fish sauce mixture! I have fond memories of consuming this with my family with the entire fish fried as is along with the impossibly crispy fish skin and tender meat, dipped in the delightfully salty yet aromatic fish sauce. Be wary, though, of leaving the fish sauce on your skin or lips for too long, as it will definitely make those areas feel itchy! Wash your mouth promptly after eating. If you have small children or are otherwise, unaccustomed to eating something with thin, sharp bones, consider sticking with the recommended fish fillets. In my childhood, my mother would coat the sliced fish fillets with egg wash and bread crumbs to help the fillets keep their shape and enhance their crispiness during the frying process. Pair this dish with a refreshing vegetable side dish such as steamed or boiled green beans, and you are set!</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients (serves 5-7)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 lbs of fish fillets</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil (divided)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 whole lemon or lime (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss fish fillets in cornstarch and dust off excess.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, add about 1/4 cup vegetable oil and heat on medium high. In batches, fry the fillets until golden brown on all sides. Transfer the fried fish to a large platter and set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the dirty oil and clean the skillet. Add about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat on medium high.</li>
        <li>Toss in garlic, ginger and shallot. Saute until fragrant. Add fish sauce, sugar, and lemon juice. Heat until mixture starts to bubble (about 30 second) then turn off heat.
