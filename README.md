# odin-recipes

**Odin Recipes** constitutes my first project from The Odin Project web development curriculum! It is also the first true project that I've pushed onto GitHub.

I believe that a little celebration is in order here... if I may be so indulgent.

It is a simple website made entirely from HTML5, containing a home page with an unordered list of three links to three separate recipe pages that I've referenced online. I spent several pomodoros (and skipped breaks :sweat_smile:) to complete this project as I became invested in writing the descriptions for each dish. There were several typos I had to correct for accuracy as well as continuity's sake, but I strove to make my commits as meaningful yet atomic as possible. As for writing multi-line commit messages... I have yet to attempt writing that, be it in VSC or the CLI, so I expect to YouTube the topic at a later time. :penguin:

There was one part that I free-styled, which was not part of the original assignment requirements, and that was adding a "Go Back Home" link to each of the three recipe pages. That took some time for me to figure out, as getting it to display at all on the webpage was initially, weirdly difficult, but after refreshing and playing with the link around ten more times and then eventually deciding to change the link from the absolute form to the relative (to facilitate its translation should I push this onto the Web), I am satisfied with the result.

I am much more confident with using basic HTML, VSC, and the CLI after embarking on this project and am really happy with the end result. I look forward to building and pushing more projects in the future, hopefully many more! :relaxed:
